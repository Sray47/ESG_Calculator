# Section C Update Fix Documentation

## Issue Background
The backend API needed to be updated to allow updating Section C data for reports with status 'InProgress'. Previously, the SQL queries in the reportRoutes.js file weren't correctly allowing updates for reports with 'InProgress' status, which was fixed for Section B but needed to be applied to Section C as well.

## Changes Made
Confirmed that the WHERE clauses in all relevant update queries already include the 'InProgress' status in the reportRoutes.js file:

1. Section A update query (line 161):
   ```javascript
   WHERE id = $${paramIndex++} AND company_id = $${paramIndex++} AND (status = 'draft' OR status = 'InProgress' OR status IS NULL)
   ```

2. Section B update query (line 236):
   ```javascript
   WHERE id = $${paramIndex++} AND company_id = $${paramIndex++} AND (status = 'draft' OR status = 'InProgress' OR status IS NULL)
   ```

3. Generic update query (line 345) - used for Section C updates:
   ```javascript
   WHERE id = $${valueIndex++} AND company_id = $${valueIndex++} AND (status = 'draft' OR status = 'InProgress' OR status IS NULL)
   ```

4. Submit query (line 404):
   ```javascript
   WHERE id = $1 AND company_id = $2 AND (status = 'draft' OR status = 'InProgress')
   ```

## Testing
Created a test script (`testSectionCUpdates.js`) to verify that each Section C principle can be updated for reports with 'InProgress' status.

## Conclusion
The fix is already in place for all Section C principles (1-9) as the status check was already updated in the relevant query. This was verified through code inspection.

## Additional Notes
- All Section C principles (1-9) are properly included in the `allowedFields` array in the reportRoutes.js file (lines 281-283)
- The backend server was restarted to ensure all changes are applied
- No code changes were required as the fix was already implemented
