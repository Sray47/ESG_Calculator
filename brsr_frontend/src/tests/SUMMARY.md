# BRSR Calculator Testing Summary

## Completed Implementation

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive automated testing solution for the ESG Calculator application that includes:

1. **Form Automation Testing**
   - Created specialized functions for Section A form filling
   - Implemented test cases that fill all fields with realistic test data
   - Supports both visible and headless browser modes

2. **PDF Generation Testing**
   - Added end-to-end tests for the form submission process
   - Implemented PDF download functionality with verification
   - Created a robust wait mechanism to ensure PDFs are fully downloaded

3. **PDF Calculation Verification**
   - Implemented PDF text extraction and parsing
   - Created validation functions to verify mathematical calculations
   - Added validation for key metrics like:
     - Employee and worker totals
     - Women representation percentages
     - Environmental metrics (water, energy)
     - Other derived values

4. **Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Updated all test files to use ES module syntax
   - Added npm scripts for running different types of tests
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the testing process

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd brsr_backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend server:
   ```
   cd brsr_frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Create a test user (first time only):
   ```
   cd brsr_frontend
   npm run test:create-user
   ```

### Form Automation Tests
```
npm run test:section-a         # With visible browser
npm run test:section-a:headless # Headless mode
```

### PDF Generation Tests
```
npm run test:pdf               # With visible browser
npm run test:pdf:headless      # Headless mode
```

### Full End-to-End Tests with Calculation Verification
```
npm run test:full              # With visible browser
npm run test:full:headless     # Headless mode
```

## Test Results

The tests produce:
1. **Console Output**: Shows test progress and validation results
2. **Screenshots**: Saved in `src/tests/screenshots` for debugging
3. **Downloaded PDFs**: Saved in `src/tests/downloads` for manual inspection

## Extending the Tests

To add tests for additional sections of the BRSR form:
1. Create specialized automation modules (e.g., `sectionBAutomation.js`)
2. Add test data in `testData.js` for the new sections
3. Update `testPdfGeneration.js` to fill the additional sections
4. Add new validation functions in `verifyPdfCalculations.js`
