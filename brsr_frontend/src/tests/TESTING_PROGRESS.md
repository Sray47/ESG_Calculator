# BRSR ESG Calculator - Testing Progress Summary

## Completed Items:
1. Created comprehensive `sectionAAutomation.js` with specialized functions for each part of Section A
2. Updated `formAutomation.test.js` to use the new automation module
3. Added multiple test cases to validate the form filling process
4. Created a specialized runner script `runSectionATests.js` for Section A tests
5. Added support for both headless and visible browser testing
6. Created configuration for Jest to handle headless mode
7. Updated package.json with new test commands
8. Added detailed README.md with instructions for running tests
9. Created `testPdfGeneration.js` for end-to-end testing of form submission and PDF generation
10. Created `verifyPdfCalculations.js` to verify that calculations in PDFs are correctly performed
11. Implemented `runFullTest.js` to combine form automation and PDF calculation verification
12. Added comprehensive validation for key calculations like employee totals, percentages, and more
13. Fixed ES modules compatibility issues in all test files
14. Added new npm commands for running different types of tests

## How to Run the Tests:

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
- Make sure a test user is created (first time only):
  ```powershell
  npm run test:create-user
  ```

### Form Testing:
```powershell
# With visible browser:
npm run test:section-a

# Headless mode:
npm run test:section-a:headless
```

### PDF Generation and Calculation Testing:
```powershell
# Test PDF generation only:
npm run test:pdf
npm run test:pdf:headless

# Full end-to-end test with calculation verification:
npm run test:full
npm run test:full:headless
```

For detailed information on PDF calculation verification, see the `PDF_TESTING.md` document.

### Running Tests:
1. **With visible browser:**
   ```powershell
   npm run test:section-a
   ```

2. **In headless mode:**
   ```powershell
   npm run test:section-a:headless
   ```

## Test Coverage:
The current test suite covers the complete Section A form automation with the following test cases:
- Full end-to-end test of Section A form completion
- Individual component tests for each section of the form

## Next Steps:
1. Run and validate the tests with the actual application
2. Fix any issues or selector mismatches that may occur
3. Extend the approach to other sections (B, C) of the BRSR form
4. Consider adding validation checks for the filled data

## Benefits:
- Automated testing saves significant manual testing time
- Uses real-world data from NALCO's BRSR report for realistic testing
- Flexible structure makes it easy to extend for additional form sections
- Both headless and visible modes support different testing needs
